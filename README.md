# Zombie Escape Configs

Collection of stuff I made for ZE.

All vscripts under the `csgo` folder must be uploaded in the exact same folder structure.

Submit an issue if you manage to find any.

Most of the configs I make are for Zeddy or for my ports.

If you need help or a guide, message me on discord (`koen#4977`).

All entwatch configs are made to work with **DarkerZ's Entwatch-DZ Plugin**. I will not guarantee compatability with other forks of entwatch plugin.
