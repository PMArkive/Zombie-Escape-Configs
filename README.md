# Zombie Escape Configs

Collection of stuff I have made and modified for ZE.

I try to publish everything publicly as I am not a fan of private configs. While I avoid posting configs made by others, I may accidentally push others' configs. If you want credit or them removed, just contact me via the options below.

## Additional Information

### CSGO

I am no longer maintaining CSGO configs due to the release of CS2. All configs under the `csgo` folder should be considered final.

> [!TIP]
> For more detailed information on CSGO config formatting, refer to the [CSGO configs guide](https://github.com/notkoen/Zombie-Escape-Configs/blob/main/Formatting%20Guide/CSGO%20Configs.md).
> [!CAUTION]
> All vscripts under the `csgo` folder must be uploaded in the exact same folder structure.
> [!WARNING]
> All entwatch configs are made to work with **DarkerZ's Entwatch-DZ Plugin**.
> [!WARNING]
> All BossHP configs are made to work with either GFL's plugin. Some `config` options may vary.

### CSS

> [!TIP]
> For more detailed information on CSS config formatting, refer to [CSS Configs](https://github.com/notkoen/Zombie-Escape-Configs/blob/main/Formatting%20Guide/CSS%20Configs.md).
> [!NOTE]
> As the current server manager on [NiDE](https://nide.gg), most of my work is already published on Nide's [ZE-Configs](https://github.com/NiDE-gg/ZE-Configs) repository.
> [!WARNING]
> Entwatch configs differ between NiDE and Unloze, so I have put all Unloze-specific configs in the `unloze` folder under the `Entwatch` folder. For more information, refer to [CSS configs guide](https://github.com/notkoen/Zombie-Escape-Configs/blob/main/Formatting%20Guide/CSS%20Configs.md) for detailed information/explanation.
> [!WARNING]
> All configs made **MUST BE** lowercase as both Nide and Unloze has made it a standard to make all maps lowercase.

### CS2

The modding environment on CS2 is still under development. Thus, I have no plans on actively contributing configs. Expect changes as plugins begin to be developed and made public.
