# Zombie Escape Configs

Collection of stuff I have made for zombie escape. I try to publish everything publicly while avoiding configs made by others. However, I may accidentally push others' configs that are private. If you want credit or them removed, just contact me via the options below.

## Additional Information

### CSGO

I am no longer maintaining CSGO configs due to the release of CS2. All configs under the `csgo` folder should be considered final.

> [!TIP]
> For more detailed information on CSGO config formatting, refer to the [CSGO configs guide](https://github.com/notkoen/Zombie-Escape-Configs/blob/main/Formatting%20Guide/CSGO%20Configs.md).

> [!CAUTION]
> All vscripts under the `csgo` folder must be uploaded in the exact same folder structure.

> [!WARNING]
> All entwatch configs are made to work with **DarkerZ's Entwatch-DZ Plugin**.

> [!WARNING]
> All BossHP configs are made to work with GFL's BossHP plugin, although some `config` options may vary.

### CSS

> [!NOTE]
> All configs I've made for CS:S are published publicly under Nide's [ZE-Configs](https://github.com/NiDE-gg/ZE-Configs) repository.

> [!TIP]
> For more detailed information on CSS config formatting, refer to [CSS Configs](https://github.com/notkoen/Zombie-Escape-Configs/blob/main/Formatting%20Guide/CSS%20Configs.md).

> [!WARNING]
> Entwatch configs differ between NiDE and Unloze, so I have put all Unloze-specific configs in the `unloze` folder under the `Entwatch` folder. For more information, refer to [CSS configs guide](https://github.com/notkoen/Zombie-Escape-Configs/blob/main/Formatting%20Guide/CSS%20Configs.md) for detailed information/explanation.

> [!WARNING]
> All configs made **MUST BE** lowercase as both Nide and Unloze has made it a standard to make all maps lowercase.

### CS2

> [!TIP]
> For more detailed information on CS2 config formatting, refer to [CS2 Configs](https://github.com/notkoen/Zombie-Escape-Configs/blob/main/Formatting%20Guide/CS2%20Configs.md).

> [!WARNING]
> All entwatch configs are made to work with  **CS2Fixes Entwatch**.

If there are maps and configs that are not present, please let me know and I can make the configs needed for the map.
