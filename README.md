# Zombie Escape Configs

Collection of stuff I have made and modified for ZE.

I try to publish everything publicly as I am not a fan of private configs. While I avoid posting configs made by others, I may accidentally push others' configs. If you want credit or them removed, just contact me via the options below.

## Additional Information

### CSGO

I am no longer actively maintaining CSGO configs due to the release of CS2. All configs under the `csgo` folder should be considered final.

> [!TIP]
> For more detailed information on CSGO config formatting, refer to [CSGO Configs](https://github.com/notkoen/Zombie-Escape-Configs/blob/main/Formatting%20Guide/CSGO%20Configs.md).

> [!CAUTION]
> All vscripts under the `csgo` folder must be uploaded in the exact same folder structure.

> [!WARNING]
> All entwatch configs are made to work with **DarkerZ's Entwatch-DZ Plugin**.

> [!WARNING]
> All BossHP configs are made to work with either GFL's, ZombieDen's, MoeUB's, or AntiTeal/Strellic's plugin. Some `config` options may vary.

### CSS

> [!TIP]
> For more detailed information on CSS config formatting, refer to [CSS Configs](https://github.com/notkoen/Zombie-Escape-Configs/blob/main/Formatting%20Guide/CSS%20Configs.md).

> [!NOTE]
> As the current server manager on [NiDE](https://nide.gg), most of my work is already published on Nide's [ZE-Configs](https://github.com/NiDE-gg/ZE-Configs) repository.

> [!WARNING]
> Entwatch configs differ between NiDE and Unloze, so I have put all Unloze-specific configs in the `unloze` folder under the `Entwatch` folder. For more information, refer to [CSS Configs](https://github.com/notkoen/Zombie-Escape-Configs/blob/main/Formatting%20Guide/CSS%20Configs.md) for detailed information/explanation.

> [!WARNING]
> Configs on NiDE are **CASE SENSITIVE**. Double check Nide's [FastDL](https://fastdl.nide.gg/css_ze/maps/) for proper capitalization. Unloze makes all map lowercase.

### CS2

The modding environment on CS2 is still under development. Thus, do not consider anything under the `cs2` folder as up to date. More information will come when I know more information.
